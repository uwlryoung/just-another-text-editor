  ## Installation
  Navigate to the page. From there you can either write in browser, or click on "Install!" to download it as an app, which will open J.A.T.E in it's own window. 

  ## Usage
  Write in any text into the body of J.A.T.E. You will notice that any JavaScript syntax will be highlighted according to what it is. Any text written is automatically saved. If you would like to use J.A.T.E. as an app, click "Install!" (if you haven't already). If you have already completed this step, then click on the "Open App" icon in the url link, select "Just Another Text Editor" and click "Open". Or, you can type in `chrome//apps` to get to get a list of apps already on Chrome, then click on  "J.A.T.E" to open J.A.T.E. in its own window. Writing in either the browser and its own window will save the text and you can safely go back and forth between the two.

  ## Challenges and Future Improvements 
  - Swapping the "Install!" button for something else once it has already been installed as an app. - Adding a feature to save the contents as a file directly onto a user's local machine. - Adding the option to select what syntax highlighting the user would like (e.g., no highligting, JavaScript, Python, etc)
